# Erik's Claude Agent SDK Demo

This repo is a living, teaching example for a minimalist agent implemented with the Claude SDK.

## Teaching Examples
- [`agent.ts`](./agent.ts) — This is the code that governs the actual agent thread! It's where you and the model talk to each other!
- [`SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`](./SYSTEM_PROMPT.md) — This is the system prompt we use to extend the baseline system prompt that already comes with the Claude SDK!
- [`.claude/skills/agent-skills-teacher`](.claude/skills/agent-skills-teacher/SKILL.md) — This is an agent skill for teach you about agent skills!
